## Dashboard Overview

The Progress Dashboard serves as a central hub for students to track their educational progress. It organizes learning content by subject areas (such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.) and visualizes completion status for various learning activities including simulations, quizzes, procedures, and animations.

### Key Features

* Visual subject-based progress tracking with circular progress indicators
* Detailed breakdown of completed activities within each subject
* Personalized recommendations based on progress data
* User profile management
* Interactive UI with modal dialogs for detailed information

The dashboard is implemented as a responsive web interface that processes and displays progress data stored in the system's database.

### Subject Cards

Subject cards display high-level progress information for each academic subject. Each card includes:

* Subject name
* Circular progress indicator showing completion percentage
* Number of available simulations

When clicked, a subject card opens a modal dialog with detailed information about the simulations and activities within that subject.

### Progress Modal Dialog

The modal dialog displays detailed information about simulations and activities within a selected subject. It includes:

* Subject title
* List of simulations
* Task completion status for each simulation (Quiz, Procedure, Animation, Simulation)
* Visual indicators for completed/incomplete tasks

Sources: [api/templates/progress\_page.html104-202](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L104-L202) [api/templates/progress\_page.html379-416](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L379-L416)

### Recommendation System

The recommendation bar provides personalized learning suggestions based on the user's progress data. It analyzes progress across subjects and activities to identify areas that need attention, focusing on:

* Subjects with lowest completion percentage
* Specific incomplete tasks within those subjects
* Next steps for improvement

The system prioritizes recommendations to help students focus on areas where they have the most opportunity for progress.

### User Profile Drawer

The user profile drawer provides access to personal information and account management functions. It includes:

* User name and contact information
* Academic class and progress statistics
* Settings and logout options

The drawer can be toggled open and closed through the user icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.

## Data Structure and Processing

### Progress Data Model

The Progress Dashboard relies on a hierarchical data structure to track user progress across subjects and activities:

This structure allows for flexible organization of educational content and precise tracking of progress at multiple levels.

Sources: [api/templates/progress\_page.html443-1214](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L443-L1214)

### Progress Calculation

Progress is calculated at multiple levels:

1. **Task Level**: Individual tasks are marked as complete ("True") or incomplete ("False")
2. **Simulation Level**: Percentage of completed tasks within a simulation
3. **Subject Level**: Overall percentage of completed tasks across all simulations in a subject

The system uses these calculations to generate progress indicators and recommendations.

Sources: [api/templates/progress\_page.html1261-1270](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L1261-L1270)

### Recommendation Generation

The recommendation system analyzes progress data to identify areas needing improvement:

1. Sorts subjects by progress percentage (lowest first)
2. Identifies incomplete tasks within the lowest-progress subject
3. Generates personalized recommendations focusing on specific tasks

This approach ensures recommendations are targeted and relevant to the user's current learning needs.

## Implementation Details

### Component Rendering

The Progress Dashboard uses client-side JavaScript to dynamically render dashboard components based on progress data:

Each subject card is rendered with event listeners that trigger modal dialogs when clicked, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

Sources: [api/templates/progress\_page.html1313-1358](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L1313-L1358) [api/templates/progress\_page.html1427-1435](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/templates/progress_page.html#L1427-L1435)

### User Interaction Flow

The dashboard supports several key user interactions:

1. **Subject Exploration**: Users can click on subject cards to view detailed simulation information
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Circular indicators provide visual feedback on completion status
3. **Profile Management**: The user drawer allows access to account settings
4. **Recommendation Guidance**: Suggestions help users decide what to focus on next

These interactions are implemented through event listeners and DOM manipulation.

## Integration with System Architecture

The Progress Dashboard integrates with several other components of the MARS-labs system:

The dashboard receives progress data from the backend database through the Flask API and processes this data to generate the visual interface. Updates to progress (such as completing activities) are synced back to the database to maintain consistency across the system.

## Summary

The Progress Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of student progress across subjects and learning activities. It combines visual progress tracking with personalized recommendations to create an effective learning management tool. By integrating with the broader MARS-labs system, it ensures that progress data remains synchronized and accurate, supporting the educational journey of each student.
