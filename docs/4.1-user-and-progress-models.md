## Purpose and Scope

This document describes the database models used to store user information and track educational progress in the MARS-labs system. It details the structure of the User and Progress tables, their relationship, and the flexible JSON-based approach used to track learner activities across different subjects.

## Database Schema Overview

The MARS-labs system uses SQLite for data persistence, implementing two primary tables: `User` and `Progress`. These tables form the foundation for tracking individual users and their educational journey through the platform.

## User Model

The `User` model captures basic demographic information about each learner in the system. It employs a straightforward structure with four fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary key, unique identifier for each user |
| `first_name` | VARCHAR(50) | User's first name |
| `last_name` | VARCHAR(50) | User's last name |
| `age` | VARCHAR(4) | User's age (stored as string) |

The model is implemented as a SQL table with the following schema:

```
CREATE TABLE "User" (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    age VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

```

Sources: [api/instance/database1.db8-14](https://github.com/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/blob/d77026a0/api/instance/database1.db#L8-L14)

## Progress Model

The `Progress` model tracks educational achievements and activities for each user. Its structure includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary key, unique identifier for each progress entry |
| `user_id` | INTEGER | Foreign key referencing the User.id |
| `progress_data` | JSON | JSON structure containing detailed progress information |

The model is implemented with the following schema:

```
CREATE TABLE "Progress" (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    progress_data JSON NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY (id), 
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES "User" (id)
)

```

## Progress Data Structure

The `progress_data` field uses a flexible JSON structure to track educational progress across different subjects and activities. This approach allows for easy expansion of the curriculum without requiring database schema changes.

### Example Progress Data

Below is an example of the JSON structure stored in the `progress_data` field:

This structure allows the system to track:

* The user's class level (e.g., grade 12)
* Progress across multiple subjects (physics, chemistry, mathematics)
* Completion status of specific activities within each subject (experiments and quizzes)

## Data Flow in the System

The following diagram illustrates how user and progress data flows through the MARS-labs system:

## JSON Field Implementation Details

The system uses the JSON field type in SQLite to store the flexible progress structure. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Schema Flexibility**: New subjects and activity types can be added without database migrations
2. **Query Capabilities**: The JSON structure can still be queried using SQLite JSON functions
3. **Storage Efficiency**: All progress for a student is stored in a single record

Sample progress data variations in the database show different tracking patterns:

```
// Comprehensive tracking across multiple subjects
{
  "class": 12,
  "subject_progress": {
    "phy": { "completed_experiments": ["ohms law"], "completed_quizzes": ["ohms law"] },
    "chem": { "completed_experiments": ["Properties of Acids and Bases"], "completed_quizzes": ["Properties of Acids and Bases"] },
    "math": { "completed_experiments": ["Pythagoras theorem"], "completed_quizzes": ["Pythagoras theorem"] }
  }
}

// Tracking for a single subject
{
  "class": 12,
  "subject_progress": {
    "chem": { "completed_experiments": ["titration"], "completed_quizzes": ["mole concept"] }
  }
}

```

## Implementation Considerations

The database models are designed with the following considerations:

1. **One-to-Many Relationship**: Each user can have multiple progress entries, allowing for tracking historical progress or different courses
2. **JSON Flexibility**: The progress structure can evolve as new educational content is added
3. **Efficient Queries**: Despite using JSON, the system maintains efficient querying through appropriate indexing

This structure integrates with the Flask API backend documented in [Backend API (app.py)](/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/2-backend-api-(app.py)) to provide progress tracking capabilities to the [Progress Dashboard](/JATAYU000/MARS-labs/3.2-progress-dashboard) interface.
